# Professional Summary
Strategic Site Reliability Engineering Lead with over 20 years of designing, deploying, and supporting high-availability e-commerce platforms. Trained in AI/ML through Purdue–Simplilearn’s Postgraduate Program and explored LLM-driven RAG, A2A, and MCP. I architect and optimize enterprise-scale systems—defining critical use cases, enhancing user experience, and enforcing reliability across AWS environments and middleware stacks (WebLogic, WebSphere, Tomcat). Equally proficient in Agile and traditional methodologies, I steer end-to-end project lifecycles from analysis and estimation through development, testing, and production support, while pioneering automation and observability strategies that reduce costs and proactively safeguard platform health.
